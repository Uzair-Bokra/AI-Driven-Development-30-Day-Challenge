# 🚀 Understanding the AI-Native Turning Point

---

## Reflection 

### 1. What does AI-Driven Development mean to me? 
For me, AI-Driven Development means using AI to help in the coding work. AI can write small code, test things, find mistakes, and give ideas. It makes the whole work faster and easy, so I don’t get stuck.


### 2. How do I see the future of Human–AI Collaboration?
I think in future, humans and AI will work side by side. Developer will think, plan, and design. AI will do the boring or hard parts. Both together will make better software in less time.
